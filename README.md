# sp-jailbreak-specialdays
This is a refactored version of the plugin [organharvester](https://github.com/destoer), Jordi, and I worked on over the past year or so. This version is slightly more modular, and should allow for easier changes as the components have been spread out.

## Commands
```
!wsd    Warden Special DAy
!sd     Special Day (Admin)
```
